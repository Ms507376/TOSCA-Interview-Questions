Q1) What is Tosca?
    Tosca is a software tool for the automated execution of functional and regression software testing.
    It supports graphical user interface,application programming interface and command-line interface. 

2)  What are the advantages of using Tosca ?
      Script less automation.
      Model based automation,we do not need to write framework for this.It is already present.
      Can be integrated with HP ALM, can run selenium scripts.
      Test management and manual testing is also present.
      Reusability of assets and copy-paste features for test cases and modules.
      Tosca provides its own query language same as SQL called as TQL.
      
3)  What are the various ways to identify objects in Tosca Testsuite?
    Identify by properties
    Identify by Anchor
    Identify by image
    Identify by index
    
 4) Explain the types of errors available in Tosca? 
 
    Verification-Failure:This occurs when verification does not provide the expected results.In simple words, the value expected by test case specification does 
    not match the value given by the test object.
    User Abort    : Abort of the test execution by the user.
    Dialog-Failure: The application wants to get control of either that doesnâ€™t exist or is not in an operational state.
    
    
5) What are the main components of Tosca?

   The major components available in Tosca are:
   Tosca Commander. ( Actual work is done here)
   Tosca Executor. ( Test cases ffrom commander is executed here)
   Tosca XScan (Tosca Wizard) ( Used to scan the application and Create Module)
   Test Repository.
   
6) How to run Tests using ExecutionLists?
   ExecutionLists in Tosca can be executed either by pressing the F6 key in the execution section or by selecting the Run option from the context menu.
   
7) How does Indentify by anchor works in tosca testsuite ?
  Identify by Anchor means Identify the object/ element uniquely by taking the refrence of other uniquely identified object/element.
  
8) How to Take the screenshot in TOSCA?
   By using standrad module TBOX TakesScreenshot.
   
9) Why Re-Scan ? What is the advantage of Re-Scan ?
  Scanning the already scanned module is called Re-Scan .
  If we have  already scanned  web page but there is some change and  two new fiels are added which we need to incorporate in same test case.
  so to get these 2 fields in already scanned module we need to re-scan.
  
10 ) what are the dynamic expression  avilable in TOSCA ?
      Random numbers {RND[<Number of Digits>]}
      Random Text    {RANDOMTEXT[<Number of Characters>]}
      
      Date Expressions : {DATE} -----> {DATE[][][ddMMyyyy]}
      Add 3 months and substract 1 day
      The expression +3M-1d means that three months are added to the base date and one day is deducted-----> {DATE[23.05.2016][+3M-1d][]} -- DD.MM.YYYY
     
      Time Expressions : {TIME} ---->hh:mm ( hour and minute)
      
11) What is Library parameter where we can define them ?
    Library paramter is nothing but business paramter which is used to paas the dynamic values in test step blocks.
    e.g library is created for Username and password 
       if we want to use Different username and password in differnt Tcs so at that time we can do by using business paramter.
       
       
12) String operation in tosca ?
    String opeartion like counting the character , Replacing of one word by other word ,verfying format of number .
    For these string operation we need AidPack downloaded and imported in the project.

13 ) How will you validate the pdf ?Can we compare pdf using tosca ?
     Tricentis has Aidpack engine which provides standard module TC pdf compare to compare pdf files.
     we can provide base file path and new file path.
     
     
14 ) Differnece between executing the test case from scratch book and Execution list ?
     ScratchBook : When we construct the testcase at that time we execute testcase by scratchbook ( Here, deatiled logs are not saved).
     Execution list : Once the testcase is ready then we execute from executionlist ( Here , detailed logs are saved).
     Jenkin execute the test cases from execution list.
     
15 ) Explain Synchronization in TOSCA ? where is setting for synchronization ?
     Synchronization means matching the application speed with automation tool speed.
     Synchronization setting is done under setting ---> TBOX ---> synchronization
     
16 ) How data driven testing is achieved in TOSCA testsuite ?
     Data driven testing in TOSCA Testsuite can be achieved by using testsheet in TestCaseDesign Section.
     we create an attribute and various instances for each attribute and finally generate the instances.
     create a template from our testcase and then attached testdata sheet to template and then instantiate the template.

17)  what is template in TOSCA?
     TestCase templates form the basis of our Tosca BI tests.When we Right cick on testcase get option convert to template .
     Drag appropriate Testdata sheet and drop on testcase template.
     Use XL paths to manually assign the TestSheet values to the required TestStepValue.
     Instantiate the Testcase Template.
