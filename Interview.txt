Q1) What is Tosca?
    Tosca is a software tool for the automated execution of functional and regression software testing.
    It supports graphical user interface,application programming interface and command-line interface. 

2)  What are the advantages of using Tosca ?
      Script less automation.
      Model based automation,we do not need to write framework for this.It is already present.
      Can be integrated with HP ALM, can run selenium scripts.
      Test management and manual testing is also present.
      Reusability of assets and copy-paste features for test cases and modules.
      Tosca provides its own query language same as SQL called as TQL.
      
3)  What are the various ways to identify objects in Tosca Testsuite?
    Identify by properties
    Identify by Anchor
    Identify by image
    Identify by index
    
 4) Explain the types of errors available in Tosca? 
 
    Verification-Failure:This occurs when verification does not provide the expected results.In simple words, the value expected by test case specification does 
    not match the value given by the test object.
    User Abort    : Abort of the test execution by the user.
    Dialog-Failure: The application wants to get control of either that doesn’t exist or is not in an operational state.
    
    
5) What are the main components of Tosca?

   The major components available in Tosca are:
   Tosca Commander. ( Actual work is done here)
   Tosca Executor. ( Test cases ffrom commander is executed here)
   Tosca XScan (Tosca Wizard) ( Used to scan the application and Create Module)
   Test Repository.
   
6) How to create and run Tests using ExecutionLists?
   ExecutionLists in Tosca can be executed either by pressing the F6 key in the execution section or by selecting the Run option from the context menu.
   
7) How does Indentify by anchor works in tosca testsuite ?
  Identify by Anchor means Identify the object/ element uniquely by taking the refrence of other uniquely identified object/element.
  
8) How to Take the screenshot in TOSCA?
   By using standrad module TBOX TakesScreenshot.
   Using dokusnapper ( Enable through TOSCA Setting).It is used to take screenshot at runtime execution.
   
9) Why Re-Scan ? What is the advantage of Re-Scan ?
  Scanning the already scanned module is called Re-Scan .
  If we have  already scanned  web page but there is some change and  two new fiels are added which we need to incorporate in same test case.
  so to get these 2 fields in already scanned module we need to re-scan.
  
10 ) what are the dynamic expression  avilable in TOSCA ?
      Random numbers {RND[<Number of Digits>]}
      Random Text    {RANDOMTEXT[<Number of Characters>]}
      
      Date Expressions : {DATE} -----> {DATE[][][ddMMyyyy]}
      Add 3 months and substract 1 day
      The expression +3M-1d means that three months are added to the base date and one day is deducted-----> {DATE[23.05.2016][+3M-1d][]} -- DD.MM.YYYY
     
      Time Expressions : {TIME} ---->hh:mm ( hour and minute)
      
11) What is Library parameter where we can define them ?
    Library paramter is nothing but business paramter which is used to paas the dynamic values in test step blocks.
    Navigate to the TestCases tab in Tosca Commander and right-click on the folder where we want to create the TestStepLibrary. 
    e.g library is created for Username and password 
       if we want to use Different username and password in differnt Tcs so at that time we can do by using business paramter.
       
       
12) String operation in tosca ?
    String opeartion like counting the character , Replacing of one word by other word ,verfying format of number .
    For these string operation we need AidPack downloaded and imported in the project.
     {STRINGLENGTH[Nice2MeetU]}=10
     {NUMBEROFOCCURRENCES[Mississippi][ss]}=2
     {STRINGREPLACE[WeekEnd][e][x][IGNORECASE]}=Wxxkxnd
     {STRINGTOLOWER[Nice Day]}= nice day
     {STRINGTOUPPER[Nice Day]}=NICE DAY
     Removes whitespace characters from the start or the end of the string- {TRIM[ no starting space ][START]}  ,{TRIM[ no starting space ][END]}

13 ) How will you validate the pdf ?Can we compare pdf using tosca ?
     Tricentis has Aidpack engine which provides standard module TC pdf compare to compare pdf files.
     we can provide base file path and new file path.
     
     
14 ) Differnece between executing the test case from scratch book and Execution list ?
     ScratchBook : When we construct the testcase at that time we execute testcase by scratchbook ( Here, deatiled logs are not saved).
     Execution list : Once the testcase is ready then we execute from executionlist ( Here , detailed logs are saved).
     Jenkin execute the test cases from execution list.
     
15 ) Explain Synchronization in TOSCA ? where is setting for synchronization ?
     Synchronization means matching the application speed with automation tool speed.
     Synchronization setting is done under setting ---> TBOX ---> synchronization
     
16 ) How data driven testing is achieved in TOSCA testsuite ?
     Tosca data-driven workflow is a method for running the exact same test steps multiple times,but each time using a different set of input data.
     Example:login salesforce sandbox with different username and passowrd everytime . here login step will be same but data ( Username and password) will be different.
     create a module ( e.g data driven) - Scan Username and passowrd 
     Create a test case and add that module ( don't pass the Username and password value that will be passed through) test sheet.
     Create test case design > (right click) select create testsheet menu
     On Testsheet - Click on Create instances menu( that is test case TC1, TC2 , TC3) 
     on Test sheet - Click on Create attribute ( e.g create an attribute for username and one for passowrd)
     Inside attribute - Create instances for Username and passowrd ( e.g.UN1 , UN2, UN3 & Pwd1,pwd2,pwd3)  Drag and drop the testsheet to test case created.
     Give the value  to attribute ( TC1-UN1 , TC2-UN2 ,TC3-UN3 & TC1-pwd1, TC2-pwd2 ,TC3-pwd3)
     drag and drop the attribute to Test case level where testsheet is attached.  ( Ref video-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGI6M8rznag)
      click Create template instance(  3 test cases will be created with  3 set of data ( UN and password) then run.
       
18 ) What is TestData Mangement ( tdm) ?
      Test Data Mangement is used to manage the test data for execution.
      TOSCA uses same database as common reposiotory does for test data management for DB2,oracle ,MS SQl server repository.      
      
19 ) What is TQL and why it is used ?
      Tosca query language it is used to query in our tosca project to find anything which we want.
      There are various functions and expression are avilable to write TQL.
      
20 ) What are different types of Action modes in Tosca? 
      There are different types of action modes in tosca 
     Input 
     Select 
     Waiton 
     Buffer 
     Constraint 
     Insert 
     Verify. 
    
21 ) Explain how you can use multiple browsers within the same test case?
     In Tricentis Tosca, we can't directly launch multiple browsers within a single test case execution. However,we can achieve cross-browser testing by using 
     a test configuration parameter named "Browser" and specifying the desired browser type (e.g. Chrome, Firefox)as the parameter value.
     Then we can execute the same test case multiple times, each time with a different browser specified. 
    
22)  How to create resusable test step block and  what it's use?
     Reusable test step blocks in Tricentis Tosca are created by right-clicking test steps and selecting "Create Reusable TestStepBlock". 
     These steps are stored in a  TestStepLibrary, allowing them to be used across multiple test cases as references.
     
23 ) Which looping statements are available in Tosca?
     To run TestSteps with branches, Tosca supports IF, DO and WHILE Statements.
     
24 )  what's the use of tosca CI/CD?
      Tosca CI/CD integration allows automated testing to be embedded directly into DevOps pipelines(e.g., Jenkins, Azure DevOps), 
      enabling continuous testing without manual intervention. It speeds up software delivery, improves quality Reduces the manual effort.

25 ) What is the advantage of linking test cases to requirements in Tosca Testsuite?
     To keep track of the requirements we link the test cases in Tosca.
     This lets us know how many requirements are covered, How many requirement test cases are passed successfully and many it's still left. 
     This actually helps us to give a high-level picture of requirement coverage.
     
26 ) when to use MATH  and when to use CALC  function 
     To perform calculations in our tests, we use the expressions CALC or MATH.
      Use CALC if you have Microsoft® Excel installed.
      Use MATH if we do not have Microsoft® Excel installed.
      
       The syntax {CALC[2x2+5]} returns the result 9
       The syntax {MATH[2x2+5]} returns the result 9.
       
27 ) Explain Recovery and clean up Scenarios ?
     Recovery scenario is set of test steps to ensure next test case execution after the failed test case run properly.
     In Recovery scenario we can re-try at TestCase level ,Teststep level and Teststep Value level.
     There is 2 condition where we can recover scenario on Dialog failure and on Verification failure.
     Setting --->TBOX---> Recovery 

    Clean up scenario:Cleanup Scenarios are automated sequences of steps run after a Recovery Scenario fails,it is designed to reset the test environment 
    (like logging out, closing apps,clearing data) so the next test can run cleanly.
    
          
28) Difference between Buffer and XBuffer and partal buffer ?
    Buffer stores an entire value (e.g., a full User ID, an entire Order Number) from a test step.
    Action Mode will be Buffer.{B[Buffername]}
    
    XBuffer :It Finds and stores only the dynamic part inside a text string,leaving the static text behind.action mode we use verify.
    (e.g. just the ID from "Order ID: 12345").
    {XB[Buffername]}
    
    TC Partial Buffer : It Takes a section(like the first 3 characters, the last 5, or everything after a specific word)from an already buffered value.
     Action mode we use input and verify for TC partial buffer.
          
 29 )  Difference between Configuration parameter and business parameter ??
      Business Parameters (PL) handle dynamic,scenario-specific data (like a user ID or product type) within reusable test blocks,
      allowing the same block to run with different inputs for different test cases.
       {PL[<Business Parameter Name>]}

       while Configuration Parameters (CP) manage static,environment-specific settings (like Base URLs or browser versions) that stay constant across 
       a particular execution environment
       In Tosca, test configuration parameters (TCPs) are applied to objects (like a TestCase or ExecutionList) and then referenced within TestStepValues
       using a specific syntax. 
        The syntax for referencing a Test configuration paramter is {CP[ParameterName]}
           
31 )How to handle the scrolling behaviour in Tosca?
    Jump to module attribute of Test Case and then select  Steering paramter ( Green Box) 
    named "ScrollingBehavior" with the value "Bottom" for the attribute.Please find screenshot below for  reference
   
        
        Name                                        Value 
        ScrollingBehavior                           Bottom
        ScrollingBehavior                            Top 
        ScrollingBehavior                           Centre
        
32)    what are the type of waits in tosca?
       Static wait( TBox Wait )  : Static wait is done with module TBox wait and test execution is paused for time specified.
       Dynamic Wait( WaitOn)     : For a dynamic wait we use the action mode WaitOn .waitOn it pauses the execution of Testcase until respective Control provides
                                   the value or  property  specified in value field.
                                   
33 ) Difference between Do and WHILE statement in Tosca ?
      Do loop    - It executes the body first and then verify for condition.
      While loop - First verify the condition and then execute body if required.
      
34) Control groups in tosca ?
     Link, button and radio button controls are grouped in Tosca.
    Link         ActionMode            Value                 Description
                  Input              <control name>          Select a link
                  Verify             <control name>          Verifies whether the specified link exists (Exists)
    
    Button        Input               <control name>          Select a button       
                  Verify              <control name>          Verifies whether the specified button exists (Exists)
                  WaitOn              <control name>          Waits until the specified button exists (Exists)

   RadioButton    Input               <control name>           Select a RadioButton
                  Verify              <control name>           Verifies whether the specified RadioButton is selected (Selected)
                  
   
35 ) what are the steering parameter in tosca ?
     steering parameters - It is a paramter which controls how Tosca performs an action on an object during test execution.
     Below are  the avilable steering paramter in tosca :
     Scrolling behaviour - value (Bottom ,top ,centre)- jump to module attribute - Properties -  green color(Create  steering parameter context menu) 
     User simulation     - value ( true or false )- Checbox selected if true
     FireEvent           - Change( Triggers specific browser events  - onclick ,onchange)
     Send Keys Delay     - 100(will input the value at small lag) 
     
36) what is firevent in tosca ?
     It is steering parameter ( which Triggers specific browser events  - onclick ,onchange) in tosca .
     The possible values of FireEvent are:onchange ,onclick ,ondblclick,onblur,onfocus,onmousedown,onmouseup,
     onmouseover, onmouseout, onsubmit, onreset

37) Excel file realted all modules name which is present in tosca?

            Data Table : .ColumnCount->CC( Buffer)
                
38)   Repetition in tosca ?
        Repetition in Tosca means performing the same test steps multiple times automatically.
        Using Repetition property in TestStep we can repeate the execution of test case multiple times in tosca.
        Select the TestStep
        Set Repetition value (like 3)
        Tosca executes that step 3 times.
        
39)  How to execut same test case 2 times in tosca through execution Entry?
       We can execute the same TestCase multiple times by adding it multiple times as separate Execution Entries in the ExecutionList.
       To do so, we define how many times we want to repeat the ExecutionEntry in the ExecutionEntry property Repetitions -i.e. 2
        ( By choosing column header on Testcase which is dragged from Scratchbook to Execution List.)

40) How to generate the report in tosca?
    We can generate the report in tosca from execution List .
    select the particular Execution List (Right Click )>Click on Print Report >Select any of the value which we want in report(Executionentries with actual  
    log,Executionentries with actual log and issues ,Executionentries with details log).
